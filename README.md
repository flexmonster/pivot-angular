## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts
Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts is a powerful and fully customizable JavaScript component for web reporting. It is packed with all core features for data analysis and can easily become a part of your Angular data visualization project. The tool supports popular frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, Blazor, and [more](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/available-tutorials-integration?r=sample_ngx). Also, Flexmonster connects to any data source, including SQL and NoSQL databases, JSON and CSV files, OLAP cubes, and Elasticsearch. 

This repository contains a sample [Angular](https://angular.io/) project for Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts.

**Note:** This version of the project uses the [ngx-flexmonster](https://github.com/flexmonster/ngx-flexmonster) wrapper, which is Ivy-compatible. Switch to the [ng-flexmonster](https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-angular/tree/ng-flexmonster) branch for the project with the legacy `ng-flexmonster` wrapper.
