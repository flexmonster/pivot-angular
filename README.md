This repository holds the TypeScript source code for simple AngularJS 4 and Flexmonster Pivot table component project. It is based on [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

## Create a new project based on this sample

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-angularjs4  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

Also, you can simply download .zip archive with the sample. 

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.
