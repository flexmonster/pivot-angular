## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts

Flexmonster Pivot is a powerful JavaScript tool for interactive web reporting. It allows you to visualize and analyze data from JSON, CSV, SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OLAP data sources quickly and conveniently. Flexmonster is designed to integrate seamlessly with any client-side framework and can be easily embedded into your application.

This repository holds the TypeScript source code for a simple [Angular](https://angular.io/) and Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts project:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. [Get it here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors. We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of Node.js and npm.

Then install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Installation

1. Download the `.zip` archive with the sample project or clone it from GitHub with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-angular.git && cd pivot-angular
```

2. Install the npm packages described in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project with the Angular pivot table from the console:

```bash
ng serve
```

## Usage
For details on usage, refer to the [Flexmonster integration with Angular](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/integration-with-angular-4/) tutorial.
