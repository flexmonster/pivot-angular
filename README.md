## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts

Flexmonster Pivot is a powerful JavaScript tool for interactive web reporting. It allows you to visualize and analyze data from JSON, CSV, SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OLAP data sources quickly and conveniently. Flexmonster is designed to integrate seamlessly with any client-side framework and can be easily embedded into your application.

This repository contains a sample [Angular](https://angular.io/) project for Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts.

**Note:** This version of the project uses the legacy [ng-flexmonster](https://github.com/flexmonster/ng-flexmonster) wrapper. Switch to the [master](https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-angular/tree/master) branch for the project with the newer [ngx-flexmonster](https://github.com/flexmonster/ngx-flexmonster) wrapper, which is [Ivy-compatible](https://docs.angular.lat/guide/ivy).
